# things-3-automation
A repo for organizing personal automations with Cultured Code's Things 3.

### Goal 1:
Can we automate the creation of "spaced repetition" tasks in our Retention project?


## Problem (Why I started this):
I wanted to have good study habits, and I wanted to use my Things 3 environment that I rely on to help me out. I've found a lot of success using spaced repetition in the past, and I excel when I use Things to handle the scheduling of these "check in's".

The catch is, it was a bit of labour up front to manually make these todo's. I had been able to overcome that and do the front-loaded admin work by copying and filling in templates, but that's still a lot of needless toil.
I anticipated that the friction of the monotonous copy-pasting of tasks was going to stop me from studying in an optimal, organized way as I went back to school.

## Solution
I automated it.

At the time of creation, the only coding foundation I had was a little bit of python.
This is a little bit clunky, especially compared to how CulturedCode has a nice guide for manipulating [Things 3 with Applescript](https://culturedcode.com/things/download/Things3AppleScriptGuide.pdf).
*In the future, I'll probably learn some applescript and "re-do" this project in that language.*

Anyways, we're using the [Things URL Scheme](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/).
The plan is to use python to interact with Things 3 using this scheme so we can automate things.
Then we can use Alfred workflows to pass in details.
